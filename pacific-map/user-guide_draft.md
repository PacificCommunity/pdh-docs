### Introduction

The [**PacificMap** ](https://map.pacificdata.org)is based on [**TerriaJS** ](https://terria.io)and other open source software. When you access data through it, you are typically accessing the data directly from the [**Pacific Data Hub**](https://pacificdata.org/data) catalogue or the organizations who are the custodians of that data.

The **PacificMap:**

* provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public from the Pacific
* facilitates the opening of data by international and regional development agencies, research and academic institutions, and local government bodies
* provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation

### How to get started with PacificMap

* You can access PacificMap either from the Pacific Data Hub main page or by using the URL [https://map.pacificdata.org/](https://map.pacificdata.org/).

* Browse through the Data Catalogue to find a data set of interest. Click on the title of your preferred data set to get a preview of that data, along with a description and other relevant metadata. To view your selected data set on a larger map, click the **Add to the Map** button. The spatial data will be immediately displayed in the map view, and a visual legend for that data will appear in the Data Workbench, located on the left-hand side of the page.

* To add additional data sets to the map, simply click **Explare map data** again in the left-hand panel to relaunch the Data Catalogue.
* Zoom manually by moving your mouse pointer over the map and using your mouse wheel to zoom in or out further.
* Click and drag the map to further show the region in which you are interested.
* Click on a feature \(that is, directly on a point or line, or within a region\) to show data about the individual feature.

### How to find out about a displayed feature

* Click on the feature which is displayed on the map. You can click on Points, on Lines or within Regions to see a display of the information available from the spatial data provider for that particular feature.
* For Points and Lines, you need to click quite accurately to identify the feature. For Regions, clicking on the boundary will give ambiguous results. Click within the region.
