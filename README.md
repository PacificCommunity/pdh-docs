# Pacific Data Hub

The **Pacific Data Hub (PDH**) aims to deliver the most comprehensive collection of data and information about the Pacific and for the Pacific, including key areas such as population statistics, fisheries science, climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and resilience, public health surveillance, conservation of plant genetic resources for food security, and human rights.

The Pacific Data Hub is an innovative programme of work, led by the [Pacific Community (SPC)](https://spc.int/) and supported by the [New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/about-us/mfat-annual-reports/mfat-annual-report-2020-21/pacific-data-hub-launched/). It is a regional public good that provides a single authoritative point of entry for data about the Pacific and serves as a vehicle for investment in a sustainable regional data infrastructure.

We have built the Pacific Data Hub platform on our intimate understanding of the Pacific region and the enduring relationships we have forged with our members. We understand the policy and development challenges that matter to our members, and we work in coordination with our development partners to provide access to timely and reliable data to inform better policy development and decision-making to help deliver better development outcomes for the Pacific region.

## A Pacific Data Ecosystem

The Pacific Data Hub is part of an emerging Pacific Data Ecosystem, a partnership between Pacific Island Countries and Territories, [SPC](https://www.spc.int/) and the [Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)](https://www.sprep.org/) to promote greater coordination in data management, dissemination and uptake initiatives. Check out the [Pacific Environment Portal](https://pacific-data.sprep.org/) for more data.

## Key Components

The Pacific Data Hub platform is made up of four key components:

1. [Data Catalogue](catalogue/)
2. [PacificMap](pacific-map/)
3. [PDH.stat](dotstat/)
4. [Microdata Library](ml/)
