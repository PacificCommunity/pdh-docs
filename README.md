# Programme Info

## Introduction

The Pacific Data Hub is an innovative programme of work, led by the Pacific Community-\(SPC\). The programme aims to enhance access to data to inform evidence-based decision making, improve monitoring, evaluation and learning, foster innovation and support our members in tackling the complex social, environmental and economic challenges they face. We set out to achieve this by understanding how our users are interacting with data, identifying challenges that require access to quality data, and developing tools and services that can help inspire new insights and extract value from data. 

We also focus on improving data management practices by working closely with our members and our development partners to increase the availability of quality data about the Pacific and ensuring that our data resources are well-managed, shared responsibly and used ethically.
