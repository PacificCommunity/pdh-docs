# Pacific Map

The PacificMap Platform provides spatial data exploration capabilities for the Pacific Data Hub.

The platform brings together geospatial datasets from the Pacific Data Hub catalogue sourced from SPC's technical divisions and its member countries.

Data is also sourced from a number of development partners and other publically available sources which provide spatial data that is relevant for the Pacific.
